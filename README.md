Quizzical is a simple quiz app, developed with React.

Data is retrieved via Open Trivia Database API (https://opentdb.com/). 

Starting the quiz fetches 5 questions, that can only have one correct answer.

After submitting the quiz answers, the app calculates the number of correct answers and gives the option to go back to the starting page to play again.
